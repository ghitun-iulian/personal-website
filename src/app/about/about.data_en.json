  "I’m Iulian Ghițun, a frontend web developer with over two years of hands-on experience building modern, scalable applications in Angular and TypeScript. My background in PostgreSQL and exposure to backend technologies like Node.js and Go give me a strong foundation, but what I truly enjoy is crafting user-focused, intuitive interfaces that make complex tasks feel simple.",
  "Before diving into web development, I worked as a graphic designer, which sharpened my eye for detail and usability. This creative foundation still influences my coding today, helping me deliver applications that are not only functional but also visually engaging. I believe great software is as much about the experience as it is about the code.",
  "Beyond my professional work, I’m developing a board game and a supporting app that dynamically generates game content and assets. Projects like this keep me exploring new ideas and pushing my skills further, blending my love for design, storytelling, and technology. My long-term goal is to collaborate on projects that bridge creativity and code, delivering digital experiences that truly connect with people."
